# Giff

Giff is a Microsoft Teams app that provides that magical feature that Slack and HipChat (RIP) have/had...a random gif generator!

Giff can be installed to a Microsoft Teams channel. To get a random gif, tag Giff and type in a word or phrase that indicates what sort of gif you are looking for.

Examples:

@giff you rule
@giff thank you
@giff earl gray hot

The Giff bot will reply with a random gif provided by the Giphy API.

Updates may be made to this code to set the rating of the gifs returned. (Use with caution!)

Have fun!
