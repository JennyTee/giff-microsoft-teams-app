# Giff

Giff is a Microsoft Teams app that provides that magical feature that Slack and HipChat (RIP) have/had...a random gif generator!

Giff can be installed to a Microsoft Teams channel. To get a random gif, tag Giff and type in a word or phrase that indicates what sort of gif you are looking for.

Examples:

- @giff you rule

- @giff thank you

- @giff earl gray hot

The Giff bot will reply with a random gif provided by the Giphy API.

Updates may be made to this code to set the rating of the gifs returned. (Use with caution!)

Note that this code will not work OOTB - additional configuration is required to integrate with Microsoft teams. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#with-an-azure-subscription for additional information. This code was working as of 8/2020, but integration with Microsoft Teams is likely to change over time.
